## [2025-04-14] - Node Placement Fix & NPC Node Editing

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Flexible NPC Node Assignment:** You can now change the NPC associated with an existing NPC dialogue node directly from the "Edit Node" panel.
    *   When an NPC node is selected, a new "Associated NPC" dropdown appears in the panel.
    *   This allows you to reassign a specific line of dialogue to a *different* NPC without needing to delete and recreate the node.
    *   This is useful for reusing dialogue structures or correcting assignments easily. The node's appearance (avatar, accent color) will update instantly based on the selected NPC.

### üêõ Fixes

*   **Intuitive Node Placement on Drag-Create:** When creating a new node by dragging a connection handle onto an empty area of the canvas, the newly created node will now appear horizontally centered directly beneath the mouse cursor's release point. Previously, its positioning could be slightly offset, making placement less predictable.
